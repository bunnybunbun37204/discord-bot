THE SO	NNETS			
by Wil	liam Shake	speare		
From f	airest cre	atures we d	esire incr	ease,
That t	hereby bea	uty's rose 	might neve	r die,
But as	 the riper	 should by 	time decease,	
His te	nder heir 	might bear 	his memory:	
But th	ou contrac	ted to thin	e own brig	ht eyes,
Feed's	t thy ligh	t's flame w	ith self-s	ubstantial fuel,
Making	 a famine 	where abund	ance lies,	
Thy se	lf thy foe	, to thy sw	eet self t	oo cruel:
Thou t	hat art no	w the world	's fresh o	rnament,
And on	ly herald 	to the gaud	y spring,	
Within	 thine own	 bud buries	t thy cont	ent,
And te	nder churl	 mak'st was	te in nigg	arding:
Pity t	he world, 	or else thi	s glutton be,	
To eat	 the world	's due, by 	the grave 	and thee.
When f	orty winte	rs shall be	siege thy 	brow,
And di	g deep tre	nches in th	y beauty's field,	
Thy yo	uth's prou	d livery so	 gazed on 	now,
Will b	e a tatter	ed weed of 	small wort	h held:
Then b	eing asked	, where all	 thy beaut	y lies,
Where 	all the tr	easure of t	hy lusty d	ays;
To say	 within th	ine own dee	p sunken e	yes,
Were a	n all-eati	ng shame, a	nd thriftl	ess praise.
How mu	ch more pr	aise deserv	ed thy bea	uty's use,
If tho	u couldst 	answer 'Thi	s fair chi	ld of mine
Shall 	sum my cou	nt, and mak	e my old e	xcuse'
Provin	g his beau	ty by succe	ssion thine.	
This w	ere to be 	new made wh	en thou ar	t old,
And se	e thy bloo	d warm when	 thou feel	'st it cold.
Look i	n thy glas	s and tell 	the face t	hou viewest,
Now is	 the time 	that face s	hould form another,	
Whose 	fresh repa	ir if now t	hou not re	newest,
Thou d	ost beguil	e the world	, unbless 	some mother.
For wh	ere is she	 so fair wh	ose uneare	d womb
Disdai	ns the til	lage of thy	 husbandry?	
Or who	 is he so 	fond will b	e the tomb,	
Of his	 self-love	 to stop po	sterity?	
Thou a	rt thy mot	her's glass	 and she i	n thee
Calls 	back the l	ovely April	 of her pr	ime,
So tho	u through 	windows of 	thine age 	shalt see,
Despit	e of wrink	les this th	y golden t	ime.
But if	 thou live	 remembered	 not to be,	
Die si	ngle and t	hine image 	dies with 	thee.
Unthri	fty loveli	ness why do	st thou sp	end,
Upon t	hy self th	y beauty's 	legacy?	
Nature	's bequest	 gives noth	ing but do	th lend,
And be	ing frank 	she lends t	o those ar	e free:
Then b	eauteous n	iggard why 	dost thou 	abuse,
